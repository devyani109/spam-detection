# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project classifies emails as **Spam (0)** or **Ham (1)** using 
**TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a machine learning project where I built a spam detection model using 
text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and Logistic Regression.

### 🔍 Features:
- Cleans and preprocesses text messages
- Converts text to numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluates model accuracy on test data
- Can be deployed using Streamlit

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional)
- Streamlit (optional for deployment)
